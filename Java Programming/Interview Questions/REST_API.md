Below is a **senior-level, concept-first explanation of REST & HTTP**, focused on **semantics, guarantees, and real interview traps**—not textbook definitions.

---

# 1️⃣ REST Fundamentals (Must Know)

---

## What is **REST**?

### **Concept**

REST (Representational State Transfer) is:

> **An architectural style for building scalable, loosely-coupled networked systems.**

It defines **constraints** on how clients and servers interact—not APIs, not payloads.

💡 **Interview line**

> REST describes *how systems should behave*, not *how endpoints should look*.

---

## REST vs **SOAP** ⭐

| REST                | SOAP                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Architectural style | Protocol               |
| Lightweight         | Heavy (XML, envelopes) |
| Uses HTTP semantics | Abstracted over HTTP   |
| JSON/XML            | XML only               |
| Easy to scale       | Complex tooling        |

💡 **Senior stance**

> SOAP standardizes everything; REST standardizes principles.

---

## What does **RESTful** mean?

An API is RESTful if it:

* Treats **everything as a resource**
* Uses **HTTP methods correctly**
* Is **stateless**
* Uses **standard status codes**
* Follows **REST constraints**

💡 **Interview clarity**

> RESTful ≠ “uses JSON over HTTP”.

---

## Is REST a **protocol** or an **architectural style**?

### ✅ **Architectural style**

* No strict spec
* No mandatory format
* Implemented *using* HTTP

💡 **Interview trap**

> REST is not something you “install”.

---

## Core **REST constraints** ⭐

1. **Client–Server**
2. **Stateless**
3. **Cacheable**
4. **Uniform Interface**
5. **Layered System**
6. **Code on Demand** (optional)

💡 **Interview gold**

> Stateless + uniform interface = scalability.

---

## What is **statelessness** in REST?

### **Concept**

Each request:

> **Contains all information required to process it.**

* Server stores **no client session**
* Authentication via tokens, not sessions

---

## Why is statelessness important?

* Horizontal scalability
* Easier caching
* Simpler failure recovery
* No sticky sessions

💡 **Senior insight**

> Statelessness shifts complexity from server memory to request design.

---

## What is a **resource** in REST?

A resource is:

> **A conceptual entity identified by a URI.**

Examples:

* `/users/123`
* `/orders/987`

---

## Resource vs **representation**

| Resource        | Representation    |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Concept         | Concrete format   |
| Stable identity | Can vary          |
| `/users/123`    | JSON / XML / HTML |

💡 **Interview line**

> You manipulate representations, not resources.

---

## What is **HATEOAS**?

### **Concept**

Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State:

> Clients discover actions via links in responses.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "links": {
    "update": "/users/123",
    "delete": "/users/123"
  }
}
```

💡 **Reality**

* Rarely implemented fully
* Shows deep REST understanding

---

# 2️⃣ HTTP METHODS (Very Common)

---

## GET vs POST vs PUT vs PATCH vs DELETE ⭐

| Method | Purpose         | Idempotent |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------- |
| GET    | Read            | ✅          |
| POST   | Create / Action | ❌          |
| PUT    | Replace         | ✅          |
| PATCH  | Partial update  | ❌          |
| DELETE | Remove          | ✅          |

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Method choice defines semantics, not payload shape.

---

## PUT vs PATCH — when to use which?

### **PUT**

* Full replacement
* Client knows complete resource
* Missing fields are removed

### **PATCH**

* Partial update
* Only changed fields sent

💡 **Senior rule**

> PUT = replace, PATCH = modify.

---

## Can GET have a **request body**?

### ⚠️ Technically yes, **practically no**

* HTTP spec allows it
* Servers/proxies ignore it
* Breaks caching

💡 **Interview answer**

> Avoid it—use query params.

---

## Is **DELETE idempotent**?

### ✅ **Yes**

* First DELETE removes resource
* Subsequent DELETEs have no additional effect

💡 **Key point**

> Idempotent ≠ safe.

---

## Which HTTP methods are **idempotent**? ⭐

* GET
* PUT
* DELETE
* HEAD
* OPTIONS

---

## Safe vs Unsafe HTTP methods

### **Safe**

* Do not modify server state
* GET, HEAD

### **Unsafe**

* Modify state
* POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

💡 **Interview line**

> Safe methods can be cached; unsafe cannot.

---

## When should **POST be idempotent**?

### **Normally**

* POST is **not idempotent**

### **Exception**

* When client supplies idempotency key
* Payment APIs, retries

💡 **Senior insight**

> Idempotency can be *designed*, even if method isn’t.

---

## Why POST is **not idempotent**?

Because:

* Server decides resource identity
* Multiple identical POSTs → multiple resources

---

## What happens if **PUT is called twice**?

* Same state after both calls
* No additional side effects

💡 **Interview clarity**

> PUT’s idempotency is about *state*, not execution count.

---

## Can **POST be cached**?

### ❌ **By default**

* No, because side effects are unknown

### ⚠️ Possible with explicit headers (rare)

---

# 3️⃣ HTTP STATUS CODES (Interview Favorite)

---

## 200 vs 201 vs 204 ⭐

| Code | Meaning    | Use              |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 200  | OK         | Generic success  |
| 201  | Created    | Resource created |
| 204  | No Content | Success, no body |

💡 **Senior rule**

> Status code tells *what happened*, not just “success”.

---

## When should you return **201 Created**?

* On successful resource creation
* Include `Location` header pointing to new resource

---

## 400 vs 401 vs 403 ⭐

| Code | Meaning                          |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 400  | Bad request (invalid input)      |
| 401  | Unauthorized (not authenticated) |
| 403  | Forbidden (not allowed)          |

💡 **Interview trap**

> 401 ≠ “no permission”.

---

## 404 vs 410

* **404**: Resource not found (may exist later)
* **410**: Resource permanently gone

💡 **Use 410** for deleted, non-recoverable resources.

---

## 409 Conflict — real use cases ⭐

Use when:

* Version mismatch (optimistic locking)
* Duplicate creation
* Business rule conflict

💡 **Interview gold**

> 409 signals *state conflict*, not invalid input.

---

## 422 Unprocessable Entity — when to use?

* Request is syntactically valid
* Semantically invalid

Example:

* Invalid state transition
* Domain validation failure

---

## 500 vs 502 vs 503

| Code | Meaning                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 500  | Server bug                                 |
| 502  | Bad gateway (upstream error)               |
| 503  | Service unavailable (overload/maintenance) |

💡 **Senior insight**

> 503 tells clients to retry later.

---

## When to return **202 Accepted**?

* Request accepted for **async processing**
* Processing not completed yet

Examples:

* Background jobs
* Long-running tasks

---

## Why not always return **200**?

Because:

* Loses semantic meaning
* Breaks client behavior (retries, caching)
* Hides errors

💡 **Interview line**

> Status codes are part of the API contract.

---

## ✅ Final Interview-Ready Summary

* REST is an architectural style, not a protocol
* Statelessness enables scalability
* Resources ≠ representations
* HTTP methods define intent and guarantees
* Idempotency is about *state*, not execution
* GET is safe; POST is not
* Correct status codes matter
* 409 = conflict, not validation error
* 202 = async accepted
* Returning 200 everywhere is an anti-pattern

---

Below is a **senior-level, interview-grade guide to REST API Design & Request/Response modeling**. This focuses on **principles, trade-offs, and real production decisions**, not surface rules.

---

# 4️⃣ REST API DESIGN & URI NAMING (High Signal)

---

## RESTful URI naming **best practices** ⭐

### **Core rule**

> URIs identify **resources**, not actions.

### **Guidelines**

* Use **nouns**, not verbs
* Use **lowercase**
* Use **hyphens**, not underscores
* Avoid file extensions
* Be consistent

### **Good examples**

```
/users
/users/123
/orders/987/items
```

### **Bad examples**

```
/getUser
/createOrder
/update-user
```

💡 **Interview one-liner**

> URLs describe *what*, HTTP methods describe *how*.

---

## Plural vs singular resources

### **Best practice**

* Use **plural** for collections
* Singular only for sub-resources or conceptual entities

```
/users
/users/{id}
```

💡 **Why plural?**

* Avoids ambiguity
* Consistent collection semantics

---

## Verbs vs nouns in URLs

### ❌ Avoid verbs

```
/createOrder
/payInvoice
```

### ✅ Use nouns + HTTP methods

```
POST /orders
POST /invoices/{id}/payments
```

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Actions belong in HTTP methods, not URLs.

---

## Nested resources — when to use?

### **Use nesting when**

* Child resource **cannot exist independently**
* Relationship is strong

Example:

```
/orders/{orderId}/items
```

---

## Deep nesting problems

### ❌ Bad

```
/users/{id}/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}/details
```

### **Problems**

* Hard to maintain
* Breaks flexibility
* Tightly couples resources

💡 **Senior rule**

> Nest only one level deep.

---

## How to model **relationships** in REST?

### **Approaches**

1. Nested endpoints
2. Links (HATEOAS-lite)
3. Query parameters

Example:

```
GET /orders?userId=123
```

💡 **Interview insight**

> Relationships are navigational, not hierarchical.

---

## Filtering vs searching vs sorting

### **Filtering**

Reduce result set

```
/orders?status=PAID
```

### **Searching**

Full-text / fuzzy

```
/orders?q=invoice
```

### **Sorting**

Order results

```
/orders?sort=createdAt,desc
```

💡 **Rule**

> One concern per parameter.

---

## Pagination — **offset vs cursor** ⭐

### **Offset pagination**

```
?page=5&size=20
```

**Pros**

* Simple

**Cons**

* Slow for large datasets
* Inconsistent results

---

### **Cursor pagination**

```
?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTAwfQ==
```

**Pros**

* Fast
* Stable

**Cons**

* Harder to implement

💡 **Senior rule**

> Offset for admin tools; cursor for high-scale APIs.

---

## How do you design **bulk APIs**?

### **Design principles**

* Single endpoint
* Array-based payload
* Partial success support

Example:

```
POST /orders/bulk
```

Response includes:

* Success items
* Failed items with reasons

💡 **Interview insight**

> Bulk APIs need failure isolation.

---

## How do you design **partial updates**?

### **Best approach**

* Use **PATCH**
* Define semantics clearly
* Avoid ambiguous updates

Example:

```json
{
  "status": "CANCELLED"
}
```

💡 **Senior clarity**

> PATCH modifies state; PUT replaces state.

---

## How do you expose **actions** in REST?

### **Correct way**

Model actions as **resources** or **state transitions**

Example:

```
POST /orders/{id}/cancel
```

or

```
PATCH /orders/{id}
{ "status": "CANCELLED" }
```

💡 **Interview stance**

> Actions are just resource state changes.

---

# 5️⃣ REQUEST / RESPONSE DESIGN

---

## What goes in **headers vs body**?

### **Headers**

* Metadata
* Authentication
* Content negotiation
* Correlation IDs

### **Body**

* Resource data
* Payload content

💡 **Rule**

> Headers describe the message; body contains the message.

---

## What is **Content-Type**?

Defines:

> **Format of the request/response body**

Example:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

---

## What is **Accept** header?

Defines:

> **Formats the client can understand**

Example:

```
Accept: application/json
```

---

## Content negotiation ⭐

### **Concept**

Server selects response format based on:

* Accept header
* Server capability

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Content negotiation decouples clients from formats.

---

## JSON vs XML — tradeoffs

| JSON           | XML               |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Lightweight    | Verbose           |
| Human-readable | Schema-heavy      |
| Faster parsing | Strong validation |
| Web-friendly   | Enterprise legacy |

💡 **Senior stance**

> JSON dominates modern APIs; XML survives in legacy systems.

---

## How do you design **consistent API responses**?

### **Standard structure**

```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "meta": {...},
  "errors": [...]
}
```

Benefits:

* Predictable
* Easier client handling

---

## Error response design **best practices** ⭐

### **Include**

* Error code (machine-readable)
* Message (human-readable)
* Field-level details
* Correlation ID

Example:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "ORDER_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Order does not exist",
  "details": { "orderId": "123" }
}
```

💡 **Interview gold**

> Errors are part of the API contract.

---

## Should error messages be **human-readable**?

### ✅ Yes — but carefully

* Safe for clients
* No internal stack traces
* No sensitive info

💡 **Senior rule**

> Human-readable for users, machine-readable for systems.

---

## How do you **version API responses**?

### **Common strategies**

1. URI versioning (`/v1`)
2. Header versioning
3. Media-type versioning

💡 **Industry default**

> URI versioning for simplicity.

---

## How do you handle **backward compatibility**?

### **Best practices**

* Never remove fields
* Add optional fields
* Maintain old versions
* Deprecate gracefully
* Version breaking changes

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Backward compatibility is a promise, not an accident.

---

## ✅ Final Interview-Ready Summary

* URIs represent nouns, not verbs
* Use plural resources
* Nest sparingly
* Model relationships carefully
* Filtering, searching, sorting are distinct
* Cursor pagination scales better
* Bulk APIs need partial success handling
* PATCH for partial updates
* Headers = metadata, body = data
* Content negotiation decouples formats
* Consistent responses reduce client complexity
* Errors must be structured and safe
* Versioning is inevitable
* Backward compatibility must be intentional

---

### 🔥 One-line senior takeaway

> Great REST APIs are **predictable, semantic, and evolvable**.

Below is a **senior-level, interview-grade explanation** of **Idempotency, Safety, Authentication, and Authorization in REST APIs**. I’ll focus on **why these exist, how they fail in production, and how seniors design them**, not textbook definitions.

---

# 6️⃣ IDENTITY, IDEMPOTENCY & SAFETY

---

## What is **idempotency**? ⭐

### **Concept**

An operation is **idempotent** if:

> **Calling it multiple times produces the same final state as calling it once.**

Key point:

* Idempotency is about **state**, not **number of executions**

Example:

* `PUT /users/123` → same result even if called 10 times
* `DELETE /orders/5` → deleted once, remains deleted

💡 **Interview one-liner**

> Idempotency means “safe to retry”.

---

## Why **idempotency matters** in REST?

Because **failures are normal**:

* Network timeouts
* Client retries
* Load balancer retries
* Mobile clients resending requests

Without idempotency:

* Duplicate payments
* Duplicate orders
* Corrupt state

💡 **Senior insight**

> If your API isn’t idempotent, retries become data bugs.

---

## How do you implement **idempotency in POST**?

POST is **not idempotent by default**, but you can **design it to be**.

### **Approach**

* Client sends a unique idempotency key
* Server stores the result for that key
* Subsequent requests with same key return the same result

Example:

```
POST /payments
Idempotency-Key: 8f3a-91bc-42
```

💡 **Key idea**

> Idempotency is enforced by the server, not the HTTP method.

---

## Idempotency-Key header — **how it works**

### **Flow**

1. Client generates unique key
2. Server checks if key exists
3. If not:

   * Process request
   * Store response against key
4. If yes:

   * Return stored response
   * Do NOT re-execute logic

### **Storage**

* DB table
* Cache (Redis)
* TTL-based cleanup

💡 **Interview gold**

> Idempotency keys turn retries into cache hits.

---

## How do **retries affect APIs**?

Retries can cause:

* Duplicate writes
* Inconsistent state
* Side-effect amplification

### **Safe retries require**

* Idempotent endpoints
* Idempotent downstream systems
* Proper timeout handling

💡 **Senior rule**

> Retries are inevitable; unsafe APIs are optional.

---

## Duplicate request handling

### **Techniques**

* Idempotency keys
* Natural business keys (orderId, paymentId)
* Unique DB constraints
* Deduplication tables

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Deduplication belongs at the system boundary.

---

## How do you prevent **double submissions**?

Common in:

* Payments
* Forms
* Mobile apps

### **Solutions**

* Idempotency keys
* Client-generated request IDs
* Server-side locking
* Optimistic locking
* UI disable-on-submit (not sufficient alone)

💡 **Senior insight**

> UI prevention is convenience; backend prevention is correctness.

---

## Idempotent **consumer** vs idempotent **API**

### **Idempotent API**

* Same request → same state
* Protects server state

### **Idempotent Consumer**

* Can process same message multiple times safely
* Protects downstream systems

💡 **Interview gold**

> APIs handle retries; consumers handle duplicates.

---

# 7️⃣ AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION (REST-Centric)

---

## Authentication vs Authorization ⭐

| Authentication | Authorization    |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Who are you?   | What can you do? |
| Identity       | Permissions      |
| Login          | Access control   |

💡 **Interview trap**

> AuthN ≠ AuthZ.

---

## Session-based vs Token-based authentication

### **Session-based**

* Server stores session
* Requires sticky sessions
* Hard to scale

---

### **Token-based**

* Client sends token each request
* Server is stateless
* Easy horizontal scaling

💡 **Senior stance**

> Stateless systems scale; stateful systems coordinate.

---

## Why REST APIs prefer **stateless auth**?

Because:

* No server memory per client
* Easier load balancing
* Better fault tolerance
* Simpler scaling

💡 **Interview one-liner**

> Stateless auth aligns with REST’s stateless constraint.

---

## JWT vs Opaque tokens

### **JWT**

* Self-contained
* Signed
* Readable claims
* No DB lookup needed

⚠️ Downsides:

* Hard to revoke
* Larger size

---

### **Opaque tokens**

* Random string
* Requires lookup
* Easy to revoke
* Centralized control

💡 **Senior insight**

> JWT favors performance; opaque tokens favor control.

---

## Where should the token be sent?

### **Best practice**

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Avoid:

* Query parameters (leakage)
* Cookies (unless browser-based with CSRF protection)

---

## What is **OAuth2** (high level)?

OAuth2 is:

> **A delegation framework**, not authentication.

It allows:

* Apps to access resources
* On behalf of users
* Without sharing passwords

Actors:

* Resource Owner
* Client
* Authorization Server
* Resource Server

💡 **Interview clarity**

> OAuth2 answers “can this app access this resource?”

---

## Access token vs Refresh token

### **Access Token**

* Short-lived
* Sent with every request
* Used for authorization

### **Refresh Token**

* Long-lived
* Used to get new access tokens
* Stored securely

💡 **Senior rule**

> Short-lived access tokens limit blast radius.

---

## Token expiration handling

### **Flow**

* Access token expires
* Client uses refresh token
* New access token issued
* Old token becomes invalid

💡 **Interview insight**

> Expiration is security’s safety net.

---

## How do you **revoke tokens**?

### **JWT**

* Token blacklist
* Short expiration
* Rotate signing keys

### **Opaque tokens**

* Delete from store
* Immediate revocation

💡 **Senior insight**

> Revocation is why many banks prefer opaque tokens.

---

## How do you **secure REST APIs**?

### **Core checklist**

* HTTPS everywhere
* Strong authentication
* Authorization checks per endpoint
* Input validation
* Rate limiting
* Idempotency for critical writes
* Proper status codes
* Audit logging

💡 **Interview gold**

> Security is layered, not a single feature.

---

## ✅ Final Interview-Ready Summary

### **Idempotency**

* Idempotency = safe retries
* Critical for POST in payments/orders
* Implemented via Idempotency-Key
* Retries without idempotency cause data corruption
* APIs prevent duplicates; consumers tolerate them

### **Authentication & Authorization**

* AuthN = identity, AuthZ = permission
* REST prefers stateless auth
* Tokens scale better than sessions
* JWT vs opaque is performance vs control
* OAuth2 is delegation, not login
* Access tokens expire; refresh tokens renew
* Revocation strategy depends on token type
* API security is multi-layered

---

### 🔥 One-line senior takeaway

> **Retries are inevitable, attackers are persistent, and systems fail — idempotency and stateless security are what keep APIs correct and scalable.**

Below is a **senior-level, interview-grade explanation** of **Performance, Scalability, Resilience, and API Evolution in REST systems**. This is exactly how strong backend engineers reason in **bank / FAANG / high-traffic environments**.

---

# 8️⃣ PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY (Senior-Level)

---

## How do you **cache REST APIs**? ⭐

### **Caching layers**

1. **Client-side** (browser / mobile)
2. **CDN / reverse proxy** (CloudFront, Akamai)
3. **Server-side** (in-memory / Redis)
4. **Database-level**

REST caching relies heavily on **HTTP semantics**, not custom logic.

💡 **Interview one-liner**

> Good REST APIs are cache-friendly by design.

---

## HTTP caching headers (ETag, Cache-Control)

### **Cache-Control**

Controls **who caches and for how long**.

Examples:

```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60
Cache-Control: no-store
```

---

### **ETag**

* A hash or version of the resource representation
* Changes when resource changes

---

## Conditional requests (If-None-Match)

### **Flow**

1. Client sends `If-None-Match: <etag>`
2. Server compares with current ETag
3. If unchanged → `304 Not Modified`
4. No response body sent

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Conditional requests save bandwidth, not server work.

---

## Why **ETag improves performance**?

* Avoids sending large payloads
* Reduces network usage
* Faster client response
* Works well with CDNs

💡 **Senior insight**

> ETag optimizes *data transfer*, not computation.

---

## Gzip compression — pros & cons

### **Pros**

* Smaller payloads
* Faster network transfer
* Lower bandwidth cost

### **Cons**

* CPU overhead
* Not ideal for small responses
* Already-compressed data gains little

💡 **Senior rule**

> Compress large, text-heavy responses—not everything.

---

## Rate limiting strategies ⭐

### **Common strategies**

1. **Fixed window**
2. **Sliding window**
3. **Token bucket**
4. **Leaky bucket**

Most production systems use **token bucket**.

💡 **Interview insight**

> Rate limiting protects *capacity*; throttling protects *fairness*.

---

## Throttling vs Rate limiting

| Rate limiting   | Throttling     |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Hard limit      | Soft control   |
| Reject excess   | Slow down      |
| Protects system | Protects users |

---

## How do you **protect APIs from abuse**?

* Rate limiting
* Authentication
* IP whitelisting
* CAPTCHA (public APIs)
* Payload size limits
* Request validation
* WAF
* Monitoring & alerts

💡 **Senior insight**

> Abuse protection is defense-in-depth.

---

## API Gateway responsibilities

### **Typical responsibilities**

* Authentication & authorization
* Rate limiting
* Request routing
* SSL termination
* Logging & metrics
* API version routing
* Circuit breaking

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Gateways centralize cross-cutting concerns.

---

## When should an API be **asynchronous**?

Use async APIs when:

* Processing takes long
* Request may timeout
* High latency downstream
* Partial failures possible

Pattern:

```
POST → 202 Accepted → status endpoint
```

💡 **Senior rule**

> Synchronous APIs are for fast paths only.

---

# 9️⃣ ERROR HANDLING & RESILIENCE

---

## How do you handle **errors in REST APIs**?

### **Principles**

* Fail fast
* Fail clearly
* Fail consistently

Use:

* Proper HTTP status codes
* Structured error bodies
* Correlation IDs

---

## Global error handling best practices

* Centralized exception handling
* Standard error schema
* Mask internal details
* Log full context internally

💡 **Interview gold**

> Clients need clarity; servers need diagnostics.

---

## Client error vs Server error

| 4xx                   | 5xx            |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| Client mistake        | Server failure |
| Don’t retry (usually) | Retry possible |

---

## Retrying failed requests — when safe?

### **Safe retries**

* Idempotent methods
* Transient failures (timeouts, 503)

### **Unsafe retries**

* Non-idempotent POSTs
* Without idempotency keys

💡 **Senior insight**

> Retry only when state guarantees allow it.

---

## Circuit breaker in REST APIs

### **Concept**

Stops calling a failing service to:

* Prevent cascading failures
* Allow recovery

States:

* Closed
* Open
* Half-open

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Circuit breakers protect systems, not services.

---

## Timeout handling

### **Best practices**

* Short client timeouts
* Server-side timeouts
* No infinite waits
* Fail fast

💡 **Senior rule**

> Timeouts define system boundaries.

---

## Partial failure handling

### **Scenarios**

* Bulk operations
* Fan-out calls

### **Approach**

* Return partial success
* Include per-item status
* Avoid all-or-nothing

💡 **Interview insight**

> Partial failure is normal in distributed systems.

# 🔟 VERSIONING & EVOLUTION (Very Common)

---

## API versioning strategies ⭐

### **1️⃣ URL versioning**

```
/api/v1/users
```

**Pros**

* Simple
* Visible

**Cons**

* URL churn

---

### **2️⃣ Header versioning**

```
Accept-Version: v1
```

**Pros**

* Clean URLs

**Cons**

* Harder to debug

---

### **3️⃣ Media-type versioning**

```
Accept: application/vnd.app.v1+json
```

**Pros**

* REST-pure

**Cons**

* Complex
* Rarely adopted

💡 **Industry default**

> URL versioning.

---

## When should you **version an API**?

* Breaking response changes
* Removing fields
* Changing semantics
* Contract incompatibility

---

## How do you **deprecate APIs**?

* Mark deprecated in docs
* Add warning headers
* Provide migration path
* Set sunset dates
* Monitor usage

💡 **Senior insight**

> Deprecation is communication, not deletion.

---

## Breaking vs non-breaking changes

### **Non-breaking**

* Add optional fields
* Add new endpoints

### **Breaking**

* Remove fields
* Change field types
* Change meaning

---

## Schema evolution strategies

* Backward-compatible changes
* Additive changes
* Feature flags
* Versioned responses

---

## How do you **notify consumers of changes**?

* Release notes
* Email / Slack
* API dashboards
* Deprecation headers
* Contract tests

💡 **Interview clarity**

> APIs are products—communication matters.

---

## ✅ Final Interview-Ready Summary

### **Performance**

* Use HTTP caching correctly
* ETags reduce bandwidth
* Compress wisely
* Rate limit aggressively
* Gateways centralize concerns
* Async APIs prevent timeouts

### **Resilience**

* Standardized error handling

---

### 🔥 One-line senior takeaway

> **Scalable APIs are cache-friendly, resilient to failure, and designed to evolve without breaking consumers.**

Below is a **senior-level, interview-grade deep dive** into **REST security, real-world failure scenarios, and commonly missed conceptual traps**. This is exactly the level expected for **Senior Backend / Bank / FAANG interviews**.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ SECURITY (REST-SPECIFIC)

---

## What is **CORS**? ⭐

### **Concept**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is:

> A **browser security mechanism**, not a server security feature.

It controls:

* Which origins can call your API **from browsers**

💡 **Key insight**

> CORS protects *users*, not APIs.

---

## Preflight request — **why it happens**?

### **When**

Browser sends `OPTIONS` before actual request if:

* Non-simple method (PUT, DELETE)
* Custom headers
* Non-standard content-type

### **Why**

* Browser asks server: *“Is this allowed?”*

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Preflight is browser negotiation, not server logic.

---

## How do you **prevent CSRF** in REST?

### **CSRF occurs when**

* Browser automatically sends cookies
* Attacker tricks user into making requests

### **Prevention**

* Use **stateless token-based auth**
* Avoid cookies for APIs
* Use CSRF tokens if cookies are required
* SameSite cookies

💡 **Senior insight**

> CSRF is a browser problem, not a REST problem.

---

## Why CSRF is **less common in token-based auth**?

Because:

* Tokens are stored client-side
* Browser doesn’t auto-send Authorization headers
* Attacker cannot inject headers cross-site

💡 **Interview gold**

> CSRF relies on ambient authority; tokens remove it.

---

## How do you **prevent SQL injection**?

### **Core defenses**

* Prepared statements
* ORM parameter binding
* Input validation
* Least-privilege DB access

💡 **Interview clarity**

> SQL injection is a coding bug, not a database flaw.

---

## How do you **prevent XSS in APIs**?

### **API-side**

* Return JSON, not HTML
* Set correct `Content-Type`
* Encode output when needed

### **Client-side**

* Escape user input
* Avoid eval-like behavior

💡 **Senior insight**

> APIs don’t execute JavaScript—clients do.

---

## How do you **validate input payloads**?

### **Best practices**

* Schema validation (JSON Schema)
* Field-level validation
* Reject unknown fields
* Length and range checks

💡 **Interview one-liner**

> Validation is a security boundary.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ REAL SCENARIO-BASED QUESTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

---

## 🟥 API is slow — how do you debug?

### **Step-by-step**

1. Measure latency (client vs server)
2. Check DB queries
3. Check external dependencies
4. Look at caching
5. Analyze payload size
6. Profile code paths

💡 **Senior rule**

> Never optimize without metrics.

---

## 🟨 Clients sending **duplicate requests** — solution?

### **Root causes**

* Network retries
* Mobile clients
* Timeouts

### **Fix**

* Idempotency keys
* Deduplication logic
* Proper retries
* Client SDK guidance

💡 **Interview insight**

> Duplicate requests are normal in distributed systems.

---

## 🟥 API backward compatibility broke — what went wrong?

### **Common mistakes**

* Removed fields
* Changed semantics
* Tight client coupling
* No versioning

💡 **Senior insight**

> Breaking clients is a contract violation.

---

## 🟥 API returning **500 intermittently** — approach?

### **Diagnosis**

* Correlate logs
* Check downstream services
* Look for timeouts
* Analyze load patterns
* Identify race conditions

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Intermittent failures are usually dependency-related.

---

## 🟨 Pagination causes **missing records** — why?

### **Root cause**

* Offset pagination + concurrent writes

### **Fix**

* Cursor-based pagination
* Stable sorting keys

💡 **Interview gold**

> Offset pagination is unsafe on mutable datasets.

---

## 🟥 How do you design API for **large file upload**?

### **Best approaches**

* Chunked uploads
* Pre-signed URLs
* Async processing
* Progress tracking

💡 **Senior insight**

> APIs should coordinate uploads, not carry them.

---

## 🟥 API timeout issues — how do you handle?

* Reduce processing time
* Async APIs (202 Accepted)
* Increase timeouts carefully
* Optimize downstream calls

💡 **Interview clarity**

> Timeouts define system limits.

---

## 🟨 How do you design APIs for **mobile clients**?

### **Principles**

* Minimize payload size
* Cache aggressively
* Use pagination
* Support retries
* Handle flaky networks

💡 **Senior insight**

> Mobile APIs must assume unreliable networks.

---

## REST vs **GraphQL** — when to choose REST?

### **REST**

* Simpler
* Cache-friendly
* Stable contracts

### **GraphQL**

* Flexible queries
* Avoid over-fetching
* Complex server logic

💡 **Interview stance**

> REST for stability, GraphQL for flexibility.

---

## ⭐ Explain a REST API you designed **end-to-end**

### **Strong answer structure**

1. Business problem
2. Resource modeling
3. HTTP semantics
4. Security
5. Performance
6. Versioning
7. Failure handling

# 🧠 COMMONLY MISSED BUT ASKED

---

## Difference between **REST and HTTP**

| REST                | HTTP                |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Architectural style | Protocol            |
| Design principles   | Transport mechanism |
| Uses HTTP           | Independent of HTTP |

💡 **Interview one-liner**

> REST uses HTTP; HTTP doesn’t require REST.

---

## Can REST be **stateful**?

### **Technically yes, architecturally no**

Stateful APIs:

* Violate REST constraints
* Don’t scale well

💡 **Senior stance**

> Stateful REST is a contradiction.

---

## Why REST prefers **resources over actions**?

Because:

* Resources are stable
* Actions change over time
* HTTP methods already express actions

---

## Hypermedia-driven APIs — real usage?

### **Reality**

* Rare in practice
* Common in internal APIs
* Shows maturity

💡 **Interview clarity**

> HATEOAS is idealistic, not mandatory.

---

## API documentation best practices (OpenAPI)

* OpenAPI / Swagger
* Examples
* Error codes
* Versioning
* Changelogs

💡 **Senior insight**

> APIs without docs don’t exist.

---

## Backward compatibility pitfalls

* Enum changes
* Field removal
* Meaning changes
* Validation tightening

---

## API contract testing — why needed?

Because:

* Prevent breaking changes
* Catch regressions early
* Protect consumers

💡 **Interview gold**

> Contracts are promises; tests enforce them.

---

## ✅ Final Interview-Ready Summary

### **Security**

* CORS protects browsers
* CSRF mitigated via stateless auth
* SQLi prevented via parameterization
* XSS is a client problem
* Validation is mandatory

### **Scenarios**

* Slow APIs need metrics
* Duplicates require idempotency
* Pagination must be stable
* Large uploads should be offloaded
* Mobile APIs must assume failure

### **Concepts**

* REST ≠ HTTP
* REST prefers resources
* Statelessness enables scale
* GraphQL trades complexity for flexibility
* API contracts must be tested

---

### 🔥 One-line senior takeaway

> **REST APIs are contracts — security, performance, and evolution are not optional features.**
